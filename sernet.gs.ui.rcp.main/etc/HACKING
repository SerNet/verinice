This document describes how to set up verinice for development. It assumes
that you are using Eclipse and are familiar with this IDE.

Software requirements:
  - Subversion client
  - Eclipse IDE (3.5.2 and higher recommended)
  - Subversion Eclipse Plugin (SVN support, http://www.eclipse.org/subversive )
  - Apache Tomcat 6.0.x
  - PostgreSQL (8.3/8.4 is ok, optional but strongly recommended)

Subversion setup:
-----------------
 - install a terminal-based subversion client through your distribution's
   package manager 

Apache Tomcat:
--------------
 
 - get a recent release of Apache Tomcat 6.0 and unpack the tar.gz file
    somewhere (note where this is, we need it at a later point)
 
 - Tomcat 6.0.x is available from: http://tomcat.apache.org/

PostgreSQL:
-----------
  - install the latest stable version through your distributions'
    package manager

Eclipse IDE:
------------
 
 - Install Eclipse 3.x (newest version of the Eclipse 3 "branch")
 
 - install the a Subversion Eclipse plugin (Subversive/Subclipse) and the
    appropriate connector (i.e. from update repository: http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.6.x)
    If  you cannot authenticate using svn+ssh, use SVNKIT (Preferences, SVN) and a private SSH key.
 
 - install the Java "Plug-In Development Environment"  and Eclipse Java EE Developer Tools
    (if not already part of your Eclipse installation)
 
 - additionally install 'JST Server Adapters'
 
 - go to Window/Preferences/Server/Runtime Environment and add a Tomcat 6.0
    environment by pointing at the directory where you unpacked Apache Tomcat
    Make sure to name it "tomcat-6" !
 
 - use the svn repository explorer and add the repository
    http://svn.verinice.org/svnroot/ (if you have write access, use svn+ssh:// instead)
    (you can specify TRUNK, BRANCHES and TAGS as the respective trunk, branches
     and tags folder)
 
 - you may get problems with Java Heap Space while checking out sernet.gs.ui.rcp.main
    for this reason, and even just to have more resources you can edit the eclipse.ini
    and change the default values for maximum heap size, by adding '-Xmx1024m'. This
    change requires a restart of the IDE
 
 - check out all projects from trunk except target-platform
 
 - check out target-platform/verinice-tp-eclipse-3.7
 
 - close all projects (important)

 - Target-Platform:
    - go to Window/Preferences/Plug-In Development/Target Platform/
    - click 'Add' and 'Nothing: Start with an empty target definition'
    - click on 'Add' and choose directory 'target-platform/verinice-tp-eclipse-3.7' as location
    - activate new target platform
 
 - open all projects, do a refresh on all projects
 
 - if eclipse mentions problems with the compiler level, follow the quick
    fix to set the version to 1.5
 
 - if eclipse mentions 'This projects needs to update WTP data' you simply do 
    right click on 'sernet.hui.server' and chose validate

 - if you cannot add the tomcat server, check the eclipse error log for problems with parsing config files 
   (sometimes you have a typo in a tomcat config file) or delete some preferences files as described 
   here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/93900/cant-add-server-to-a-moved-workspace

 - if you get "access restricted" error, go to preferences, java, compiler, restricted api and switch from "error" to "warning"

 - if spurious classpath errors occur you just right-click on a project and chose 
   'PDE Tools/Update classpath ...'.
   
 - if you get an error saying that "some.bundle/src" cannot be nested inside "some.bundle", right click on the project, 
   choose properties / java build path, remove the "src" folder, *add it again* and click "OK". After that, 
   choose "PDE Tools, Update Class path" (see above) 
   
 - if you can't get rid of "missing packages" errors and are sure that you have everything in your own plugins or target platform, 
   go to the broken bundle's manifest.mf and remove one of the required bundles, then add it again. This will
   cause a rebuild that sometimes fixes the problem. 
 
 - open the 'Servers' view (Window/Show View/Others...)
    - do a right-click and chose 'New/Server'
    - chose Tomcat 6 (with your "tomcat-6" runtime environment)
    - add the sernet.gs.sever project (if you cannot do this, you did not install the Java EE Development Plugin)
    - copy sernet.gs.server/lib/jsf-additional/*.jar into tomcat/lib
 
 - download the catalogues IT-Grundschutz and the Datenschutzbaustein
    and place both files into the WebContent/WEB-INF directory of the
    sernet.gs.server project (do a refresh in Eclipse for that project)
    The catalogues can be found on this page:
    https://www.bsi.bund.de/cln_155/DE/Themen/weitereThemen/ITGrundschutzKataloge/Download/download_node.html
 
 - edit WebContent/WEB-INF/veriniceserver-plain.properties and add your
    database settings (if you followed the advice to call the db verinicedb,
    have PostgreSQL running on port 5432 and used verinice as user/password
    then nothing needs to be configured)

- run ./update-jars in sernet.gs.server
    - press F5 on project sernet.gs.server to refresh it

  - create a run configuration ('Eclipse Application') based on the file
    oc.product of the project sernet.gs.ui.rcp.main.feature
    - double-click on oc.product
    - open the run configuration dialog, click launch
    - open run, runconfigurations
    - go to plugins of the oc.product (verinice) configuration
    - if it is not checked, manually add: sernet.gs.server and all other pliugins (but not the features!)
    - click on 'Add Required Plug-ins'
    - click on apply and then validate to check whether there are really
      no missing bundles

As of now you can:
 
 - start the standalone (no-OSGI) verinice server by starting Tomcat
    from Eclipse

  - start the verinice client (oc.product) which automatically starts an
    internal server on port 8800 when configured for the standalone
    mode

  - If you get exception saying there is no schema
    for Spring security, then the OSGi extender is not running.
