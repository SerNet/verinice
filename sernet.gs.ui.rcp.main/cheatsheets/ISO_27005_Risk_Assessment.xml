  <intro>
    <description>
      This tutorial will show you how to accomplish a risk assessment based on the international
      standards ISO 27005 with verinice. Let's get started.
    </description>
  </intro>
  
  <item title="Change to the ISM perspective">
    <description>
      First, you have to switch to the ISM perspective. If you have not done so already, choose this
      perspective by selecting it from the menu via <b>View > Show Perspective > ISM Perspective</b>.
    </description>
  </item>
  
  <item title="Create a new scope">
    <description>
      Create a new scope by clicking the "Add new organization" icon in the ISM view. It looks like
      an empty sheet with a yellow star in the top right corner.
      <br /><br />
      Double click on the scope. Change its name to "My Organization".
      Set the "Risk Acceptance" levels to "3" for confidentiality, integrity and availability.
      Save your changes by clicking <b>File > Save</b> or by pressing <b>Ctrl+S</b>.
      <br /><br />
      Scroll down and read through the definitions of business impact, threat and vulnerability
      levels. You will have to change these to fit your actual organization later.
    </description>
  </item>
  
  <item title="Create a new asset">
    <description>
      Expand the scope object. Right-click on the "Assets" category. Choose <b>Add New Asset...</b>.
      Enter "Mail server" as title and change the type of the asset to "Physical". Save by pressing
      <b>Ctrl+S</b>.
    </description>
  </item>
  
  <item title="Create a new process">
    <description>
      Right-click "Processes". Choose <b>Add Process...</b>. Enter "Marketing" as title and set the
      "Business Impact" to "Confidentiality: Public", "Integrity: Normal", "Availability: High".
      Save by pressing <b>Ctrl+S</b>.
      <br /><br />
      Link your asset to the process. One way to do this is located in the editor. Open the
      drop down menu next to the label "Relations to:" and choose "Asset". Click <b>Add...</b>.
      Select your asset and click <b>OK</b>. The caption will show "depends on" now meaning the
      process "Marketing" depends on a functioning "Mail Server" to work.
    </description>
  </item>
  
  <item title="Create a new vulnerability">
    <description>
      Right-click on the "Vulnerabilities" category in the ISM view. Choose <b>Add Vulnerability...</b>.
      Enter "Remote exploit" as title and set the "Vulnerability Level" to "1: Low". Save by
      pressing <b>Ctrl+S</b>.
    </description>
  </item>
  
  <item title="Create a new threat">
    <description>
      Right-click on the "Threats" category. Choose <b>Add Threat...</b>. Enter "External attacker"
      as title and set the "Likelihood" level to "4: Daily". Save by pressing <b>Ctrl+S</b>.
    </description>
  </item>
  
  <item title="Create a new scenario">
    <description>
      So far, you have created separate objects, but you have not yet connected them with each other to
      represent an actual risk scenario. Let's do that now. Connect the threat you have just created
      with the vulnerability to create a new scenario. Use your mouse to drag and drop the threat over
      to the vulnerarbility in the ISM view.
      <br /><br />
      Now verinice asks you if you want to create a new scenario, click "Yes". The new object should
      appear under the "Scenarios" group. If it doesn't, press <b>Ctrl+F5</b> to refresh your view.
    </description>
  </item>
  
  <item title="Connect scenario and asset">
    <description>
      Now we have to connect our scenario with our mail server to show that something could go wrong with
      it. Either drag and drop the scenario over to the asset or open the mail server and use the
      "Relations to:" drop down menu to connect it with your scenario.
    </description>
  </item>
  
  <item title="Running the risk calculation">
    <description>
      This is important: threat levels and risk values are only updated after you click the "Run risk
      analysis" button. This action button is available on the upper button bar for faster access.
      Click the button now.
    </description>
  </item>
  
  <item title="Check risk values">
    <description>
      Double-click the "Mail server" asset, it will have inherited the business impact from the "Marketing"
      process. In the relations area of the editor, you will now see numbers next to the scenario (scroll
      the are to the right if you cannot see them). They mean, that the scenario adds to the total risk
      for this asset. Risk is calculated separately for confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA).
    </description>
  </item>
  
  <item title="Create a second scenario (shortcut)">
    <description>
      You do not have to create an actual threat/vulnerability object for each scenario that you want
      to take care of in verinice. You can also just right-click on "scenarios" and choose
      "Add scenario". You can enter values for threat and likelihood of this scenario right here.
      In this case, you should disable the checkbox "Deduce from threat and vuln." to prevent your
      settings from being overwritten by the risk calculation.
      <br /><br />
      If you buy verinice.PRO, you will get an extensive catalog of common scenarios based on the
      threats and vulnerabilities that are contained in the annex of ISO 27005.
    </description>
  </item>
  
  <item title="Fine tuning the risk analysis">
    <description>
      By default, a scenario is assumed to affect all three impact categories: confidentiality, integrity
      and availability. You can fine-tune this by disabling some of the checkboxes in the scenario
      editor, i.&#160;e. a flood affects availability, but maybe not confidentiality.
    </description>
  </item>
  
  <item title="Create a risk assessment report">
    <description>
      Click <b>File > Generate report...</b>. Select the "ISM: Risk Management Results" report. Choose your
      scope being the top level element. Select "PDF" as output type and select a directory and a filename
      to save the report to. Click <b>OK</b>. You can open the generated report with any PDF viewer.
    </description>
  </item>
  
  <item title="Risk Treatment">
    <description>
      Now we have to do something about the identified risks. Create a new control by right-clicking
      on "Controls" and choose <b>Add Control...</b>. Enter "Patch Management" as title, set
      "Implemented" to "Yes". Scroll down to "Control Strength" and "Probability of scenario". 
      Choose there "Modifies 1 level". Save by pressing <b>Ctrl+S</b>.
    </description>
  </item>
  
  <item title="Applying controls">
    <description>
      Create a relation between the control and the scenario.
      <br /><br />
      Controls can be applied to a scenario or to single assets. The control will thereby reduce the
      impact of a risk towards individual assets or for all assets that are affected by a scenario.
      <br /><br />
      If you double-click the scenario in the list, you will see all relations from the scenarios
      side. For instance, the link to the control should read "likelihood modified by" "Patch Management".
      The control will be displayed as a green checkmark to show that it is already implemented.
