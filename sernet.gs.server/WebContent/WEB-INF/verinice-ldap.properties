#
# LDAP / ActiveDirectory(tm) configuration, uses a customized LDAP query to 
# look up user's passwords on a directory server. This allows
# users to log into verinice with their usual password.
#
# The user account must be created under the same name in verinice by a verinice
# administrator first.
#
# Application roles (authorities) are always kept in the verinice database.
#
# All of this can be changed by more sophisticated configuration, please contact 
# verinice@sernet.com if this doesn't fulfill your needs!
#
# CAUTION: Without SSL, passwords are transmitted in cleartext over the network when using LDAP / AD auth.
# When using LDAP auth you should always switch to SSL, please see the installation manual for more details.
#
# You have to switch the security context in WEB-INF/web.xml to "ldap" for the following settings to take effect.
#
# If you are running an OpenLDAP Server you can test authentification by an ldapsearch command
# ldapsearch -x -W -h <ldap.server> -p <ldap.port> -D <ldap.prefix><NAME><ldap.suffix> "(uid=<NAME>)"

# (optional) LDAP base to query the username, i.e. "dc=W2K3AD,dc=ORG" or "dc=W2K3AD,dc=ORG?sAMAccountName?sub?(objectClass=*)"
# Can usually be left empty.

# (optional) Prefix to put before everything the user enters as username. Use double backslashes to escape,

# It doesn't hurt defining the account name here as long as the account under this name doesn't actually exist
# in verinice.
