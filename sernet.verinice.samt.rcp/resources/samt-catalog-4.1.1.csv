,,,,,,,,,
,,,<b>Objective:</b>,,,,,,
,,,"The handling of mobile devices, particularly in unprotected environments, is associated with increased risks (e.g. loss, theft, malware infection).

,,,,,,,,,
,,,<h1>To what extent are the roles and responsibilities defined which are shared between IT service providers (e.g. cloud providers) and the own organization?</h1>,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,<b>Objective:</b>,,,,,,
,,,"When using services and IT services (e.g. cloud services), the relationship between provider and the own organization is of particular significance to information security due to the shared responsibilities for the implementation of requirements. The own organization must continue to independently fulfil parts of the security requirements while other requirements are fulfilled in whole or in part by the service provider. The exact allocation of responsibilities always depends on the IT service or the service used and cannot be generally indicated.

If common understanding regarding the allocation of responsibilities is lacking among all parties involved, the security system may be weakened or rendered entirely ineffective. Therefore, the user of services and IT services must ensure at all times that a mutual understanding regarding the allocation of responsibilities is given and that it is clarified for each requirement, that and by whom it is fulfilled.",,,,,,

- Level 0: Incomplete
- Level 1: Performed
- Level 2: Managed
- Level 3: Established
- Level 4: Predictable
- Level 5: Optimizing

Activities are assigned to the single levels which ensure that the results are systematically derived and will be available in the defined quality at the end of the process.

During assessment, conformity with the requirements of the corresponding level shall be objectively demonstrated. This can be done, for example, by means of work products resulting from the processes of the controls or by means of interview statements by persons carrying out the process.",,,,,,
